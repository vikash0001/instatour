                    <p><strong>1. How much is the tour?</strong><br>19.75 pound/euro unless you use a discount
                        code.<br>
                        <br><strong>2. How do I get a discount code?</strong><br>Find one through our
                        marketing campaigns. Alternatively email me a good joke at conor@insta.tours, with the

                        turnaround time of 48 hours and we may not be able to reply to every email. The funnier
                        the joke, the better the discount. Note that discount codes can’t be used in conjunction
                        with other discount codes.<br> <br><strong>3. How long is the tour?</strong><br>Each tour is
